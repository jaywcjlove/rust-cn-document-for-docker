<h2 id="general"><a class="header" href="#general">General</a></h2>
<p>Rust provides three tiers of target support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust provides no guarantees about tier 3 targets; they exist in the codebase,
but may or may not build.</li>
<li>Rust's continuous integration checks that tier 2 targets will always build,
but they may or may not pass tests.</li>
<li>Rust's continuous integration checks that tier 1 targets will always build
and pass tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding a new tier 3 target imposes minimal requirements; we focus primarily on
avoiding disruption to other ongoing Rust development.</p>
<p>Tier 2 and tier 1 targets place work on Rust project developers as a whole, to
avoid breaking the target. The broader Rust community may also feel more
inclined to support higher-tier targets in their crates (though they are not
obligated to do so). Thus, these tiers require commensurate and ongoing efforts
from the maintainers of the target, to demonstrate value and to minimize any
disruptions to ongoing Rust development.</p>
<p>This policy defines the requirements for accepting a proposed target at a given
level of support.</p>
<p>Each tier builds on all the requirements from the previous tier, unless
overridden by a stronger requirement. Targets at tier 2 and tier 1 may also
provide <em>host tools</em> (such as <code>rustc</code> and <code>cargo</code>); each of those tiers
includes a set of supplementary requirements that must be met if supplying host
tools for the target. A target at tier 2 or tier 1 is not required to supply
host tools, but if it does, it must meet the corresponding additional
requirements for host tools.</p>
<p>The policy for each tier also documents the Rust governance teams that must
approve the addition of any target at that tier. Those teams are responsible
for reviewing and evaluating the target, based on these requirements and their
own judgment. Those teams may apply additional requirements, including
subjective requirements, such as to deal with issues not foreseen by this
policy. (Such requirements may subsequently motivate additions to this policy.)</p>
<p>While these criteria attempt to document the policy, that policy still involves
human judgment. Targets must fulfill the spirit of the requirements as well, as
determined by the judgment of the approving teams. Reviewers and team members
evaluating targets and target-specific patches should always use their own best
judgment regarding the quality of work, and the suitability of a target for the
Rust project. Neither this policy nor any decisions made regarding targets
shall create any binding agreement or estoppel by any party.</p>
<p>Before filing an issue or pull request (PR) to introduce or promote a target,
the target should already meet the corresponding tier requirements. This does
not preclude an existing target's maintainers using issues (on the Rust
repository or otherwise) to track requirements that have not yet been met, as
appropriate; however, before officially proposing the introduction or promotion
of a target, it should meet all of the necessary requirements. A target
proposal must quote the corresponding requirements verbatim and respond to them
as part of explaining how the target meets those requirements. (For the
requirements that simply state that the target or the target developers must
not do something, it suffices to acknowledge the requirement.)</p>
<p>For a list of all supported targets and their corresponding tiers (&quot;tier 3&quot;,
&quot;tier 2&quot;, &quot;tier 2 with host tools&quot;, &quot;tier 1&quot;, or &quot;tier 1 with host tools&quot;), see
<a href="platform-support.html">platform support</a>.</p>
<p>Several parts of this policy require providing target-specific documentation.
Such documentation should typically appear in a subdirectory of the
platform-support section of this rustc manual, with a link from the target's
entry in <a href="platform-support.html">platform support</a>. Use
<a href="platform-support/TEMPLATE.html">TEMPLATE.md</a> as a base, and see other
documentation in that directory for examples.</p>
<p>Note that a target must have already received approval for the next lower tier,
and spent a reasonable amount of time at that tier, before making a proposal
for promotion to the next higher tier; this is true even if a target meets the
requirements for several tiers at once. This policy leaves the precise
interpretation of &quot;reasonable amount of time&quot; up to the approving teams; those
teams may scale the amount of time required based on their confidence in the
target and its demonstrated track record at its current tier. At a minimum,
multiple stable releases of Rust should typically occur between promotions of a
target.</p>
<p>The availability or tier of a target in stable Rust is not a hard stability
guarantee about the future availability or tier of that target. Higher-level
target tiers are an increasing commitment to the support of a target, and we
will take that commitment and potential disruptions into account when
evaluating the potential demotion or removal of a target that has been part of
a stable release. The promotion or demotion of a target will not generally
affect existing stable releases, only current development and future releases.</p>
<p>In this policy, the words &quot;must&quot; and &quot;must not&quot; specify absolute requirements
that a target must meet to qualify for a tier. The words &quot;should&quot; and &quot;should
not&quot; specify requirements that apply in almost all cases, but for which the
approving teams may grant an exception for good reason. The word &quot;may&quot;
indicates something entirely optional, and does not indicate guidance or
recommendations. This language is based on <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">IETF RFC
2119</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tier-3-target-policy"><a class="header" href="#tier-3-target-policy">Tier 3 target policy</a></h2>
<p>At this tier, the Rust project provides no official support for a target, so we
place minimal requirements on the introduction of targets.</p>
<p>A proposed new tier 3 target must be reviewed and approved by a member of the
compiler team based on these requirements. The reviewer may choose to gauge
broader compiler team consensus via a <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/mcp.html">Major Change Proposal (MCP)</a>.</p>
<p>A proposed target or target-specific patch that substantially changes code
shared with other targets (not just target-specific code) must be reviewed and
approved by the appropriate team for that shared code before acceptance.</p>
<ul>
<li>A tier 3 target must have a designated developer or developers (the &quot;target
maintainers&quot;) on record to be CCed when issues arise regarding the target.
(The mechanism to track and CC such developers may evolve over time.)</li>
<li>Targets must use naming consistent with any existing targets; for instance, a
target for the same CPU or OS as an existing Rust target should use the same
name for that CPU or OS. Targets should normally use the same names and
naming conventions as used elsewhere in the broader ecosystem beyond Rust
(such as in other toolchains), unless they have a very good reason to
diverge. Changing the name of a target can be highly disruptive, especially
once the target reaches a higher tier, so getting the name right is important
even for a tier 3 target.
<ul>
<li>Target names should not introduce undue confusion or ambiguity unless
absolutely necessary to maintain ecosystem compatibility. For example, if
the name of the target makes people extremely likely to form incorrect
beliefs about what it targets, the name should be changed or augmented to
disambiguate it.</li>
<li>If possible, use only letters, numbers, dashes and underscores for the name.
Periods (<code>.</code>) are known to cause issues in Cargo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tier 3 targets may have unusual requirements to build or use, but must not
create legal issues or impose onerous legal terms for the Rust project or for
Rust developers or users.
<ul>
<li>The target must not introduce license incompatibilities.</li>
<li>Anything added to the Rust repository must be under the standard Rust
license (<code>MIT OR Apache-2.0</code>).</li>
<li>The target must not cause the Rust tools or libraries built for any other
host (even when supporting cross-compilation to the target) to depend
on any new dependency less permissive than the Rust licensing policy. This
applies whether the dependency is a Rust crate that would require adding
new license exceptions (as specified by the <code>tidy</code> tool in the
rust-lang/rust repository), or whether the dependency is a native library
or binary. In other words, the introduction of the target must not cause a
user installing or running a version of Rust or the Rust tools to be
subject to any new license requirements.</li>
<li>Compiling, linking, and emitting functional binaries, libraries, or other
code for the target (whether hosted on the target itself or cross-compiling
from another target) must not depend on proprietary (non-FOSS) libraries.
Host tools built for the target itself may depend on the ordinary runtime
libraries supplied by the platform and commonly used by other applications
built for the target, but those libraries must not be required for code
generation for the target; cross-compilation to the target must not require
such libraries at all. For instance, <code>rustc</code> built for the target may
depend on a common proprietary C runtime library or console output library,
but must not depend on a proprietary code generation library or code
optimization library. Rust's license permits such combinations, but the
Rust project has no interest in maintaining such combinations within the
scope of Rust itself, even at tier 3.</li>
<li>&quot;onerous&quot; here is an intentionally subjective term. At a minimum, &quot;onerous&quot;
legal/licensing terms include but are <em>not</em> limited to: non-disclosure
requirements, non-compete requirements, contributor license agreements
(CLAs) or equivalent, &quot;non-commercial&quot;/&quot;research-only&quot;/etc terms,
requirements conditional on the employer or employment of any particular
Rust developers, revocable terms, any requirements that create liability
for the Rust project or its developers or users, or any requirements that
adversely affect the livelihood or prospects of the Rust project or its
developers or users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neither this policy nor any decisions made regarding targets shall create any
binding agreement or estoppel by any party. If any member of an approving
Rust team serves as one of the maintainers of a target, or has any legal or
employment requirement (explicit or implicit) that might affect their
decisions regarding a target, they must recuse themselves from any approval
decisions regarding the target's tier status, though they may otherwise
participate in discussions.
<ul>
<li>This requirement does not prevent part or all of this policy from being
cited in an explicit contract or work agreement (e.g. to implement or
maintain support for a target). This requirement exists to ensure that a
developer or team responsible for reviewing and approving a target does not
face any legal threats or obligations that would prevent them from freely
exercising their judgment in such approval, even if such judgment involves
subjective matters or goes beyond the letter of these requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tier 3 targets should attempt to implement as much of the standard libraries
as possible and appropriate (<code>core</code> for most targets, <code>alloc</code> for targets
that can support dynamic memory allocation, <code>std</code> for targets with an
operating system or equivalent layer of system-provided functionality), but
may leave some code unimplemented (either unavailable or stubbed out as
appropriate), whether because the target makes it impossible to implement or
challenging to implement. The authors of pull requests are not obligated to
avoid calling any portions of the standard library on the basis of a tier 3
target not implementing those portions.</li>
<li>The target must provide documentation for the Rust community explaining how
to build for the target, using cross-compilation if possible. If the target
supports running binaries, or running tests (even if they do not pass), the
documentation must explain how to run such binaries or tests for the target,
using emulation if possible or dedicated hardware if necessary.</li>
<li>Tier 3 targets must not impose burden on the authors of pull requests, or
other developers in the community, to maintain the target. In particular,
do not post comments (automated or manual) on a PR that derail or suggest a
block on the PR based on a tier 3 target. Do not send automated messages or
notifications (via any medium, including via <code>@</code>) to a PR author or others
involved with a PR regarding a tier 3 target, unless they have opted into
such messages.
<ul>
<li>Backlinks such as those generated by the issue/PR tracker when linking to
an issue or PR are not considered a violation of this policy, within
reason. However, such messages (even on a separate repository) must not
generate notifications to anyone involved with a PR who has not requested
such notifications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Patches adding or updating tier 3 targets must not break any existing tier 2
or tier 1 target, and must not knowingly break another tier 3 target without
approval of either the compiler team or the maintainers of the other tier 3
target.
<ul>
<li>In particular, this may come up when working on closely related targets,
such as variations of the same architecture with different features. Avoid
introducing unconditional uses of features that another variation of the
target may not have; use conditional compilation or runtime detection, as
appropriate, to let each target run code supported by that target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a tier 3 target stops meeting these requirements, or the target maintainers
no longer have interest or time, or the target shows no signs of activity and
has not built for some time, or removing the target would improve the quality
of the Rust codebase, we may post a PR to remove it; any such PR will be CCed
to the target maintainers (and potentially other people who have previously
worked on the target), to check potential interest in improving the situation.</p>
<h2 id="tier-2-target-policy"><a class="header" href="#tier-2-target-policy">Tier 2 target policy</a></h2>
<p>At this tier, the Rust project guarantees that a target builds, and will reject
patches that fail to build on a target. Thus, we place requirements that ensure
the target will not block forward progress of the Rust project.</p>
<p>A proposed new tier 2 target must be reviewed and approved by the compiler team
based on these requirements. Such review and approval may occur via a <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/mcp.html">Major
Change Proposal (MCP)</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, the infrastructure team must approve the integration of the target
into Continuous Integration (CI), and the tier 2 CI-related requirements. This
review and approval may take place in a PR adding the target to CI, or simply
by an infrastructure team member reporting the outcome of a team discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>A tier 2 target must have value to people other than its maintainers. (It may
still be a niche target, but it must not be exclusively useful for an
inherently closed group.)</li>
<li>A tier 2 target must have a designated team of developers (the &quot;target
maintainers&quot;) available to consult on target-specific build-breaking issues,
or if necessary to develop target-specific language or library implementation
details. This team must have at least 2 developers.
<ul>
<li>The target maintainers should not only fix target-specific issues, but
should use any such issue as an opportunity to educate the Rust community
about portability to their target, and enhance documentation of the target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The target must not place undue burden on Rust developers not specifically
concerned with that target. Rust developers are expected to not gratuitously
break a tier 2 target, but are not expected to become experts in every tier 2
target, and are not expected to provide target-specific implementations for
every tier 2 target.</li>
<li>The target must provide documentation for the Rust community explaining how
to build for the target using cross-compilation, and explaining how to run
tests for the target. If at all possible, this documentation should show how
to run Rust programs and tests for the target using emulation, to allow
anyone to do so. If the target cannot be feasibly emulated, the documentation
should explain how to obtain and work with physical hardware, cloud systems,
or equivalent.</li>
<li>The target must document its baseline expectations for the features or
versions of CPUs, operating systems, libraries, runtime environments, and
similar.</li>
<li>If introducing a new tier 2 or higher target that is identical to an existing
Rust target except for the baseline expectations for the features or versions
of CPUs, operating systems, libraries, runtime environments, and similar,
then the proposed target must document to the satisfaction of the approving
teams why the specific difference in baseline expectations provides
sufficient value to justify a separate target.
<ul>
<li>Note that in some cases, based on the usage of existing targets within the
Rust community, Rust developers or a target's maintainers may wish to
modify the baseline expectations of a target, or split an existing target
into multiple targets with different baseline expectations. A proposal to
do so will be treated similarly to the analogous promotion, demotion, or
removal of a target, according to this policy, with the same team approvals
required.
<ul>
<li>For instance, if an OS version has become obsolete and unsupported, a
target for that OS may raise its baseline expectations for OS version
(treated as though removing a target corresponding to the older
versions), or a target for that OS may split out support for older OS
versions into a lower-tier target (treated as though demoting a target
corresponding to the older versions, and requiring justification for a
new target at a lower tier for the older OS versions).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tier 2 targets must not leave any significant portions of <code>core</code> or the
standard library unimplemented or stubbed out, unless they cannot possibly be
supported on the target.
<ul>
<li>The right approach to handling a missing feature from a target may depend
on whether the target seems likely to develop the feature in the future. In
some cases, a target may be co-developed along with Rust support, and Rust
may gain new features on the target as that target gains the capabilities
to support those features.</li>
<li>As an exception, a target identical to an existing tier 1 target except for
lower baseline expectations for the OS, CPU, or similar, may propose to
qualify as tier 2 (but not higher) without support for <code>std</code> if the target
will primarily be used in <code>no_std</code> applications, to reduce the support
burden for the standard library. In this case, evaluation of the proposed
target's value will take this limitation into account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The code generation backend for the target should not have deficiencies that
invalidate Rust safety properties, as evaluated by the Rust compiler team.
(This requirement does not apply to arbitrary security enhancements or
mitigations provided by code generation backends, only to those properties
needed to ensure safe Rust code cannot cause undefined behavior or other
unsoundness.) If this requirement does not hold, the target must clearly and
prominently document any such limitations as part of the target's entry in
the target tier list, and ideally also via a failing test in the testsuite.
The Rust compiler team must be satisfied with the balance between these
limitations and the difficulty of implementing the necessary features.
<ul>
<li>For example, if Rust relies on a specific code generation feature to ensure
that safe code cannot overflow the stack, the code generation for the
target should support that feature.</li>
<li>If the Rust compiler introduces new safety properties (such as via new
capabilities of a compiler backend), the Rust compiler team will determine
if they consider those new safety properties a best-effort improvement for
specific targets, or a required property for all Rust targets. In the
latter case, the compiler team may require the maintainers of existing
targets to either implement and confirm support for the property or update
the target tier list with documentation of the missing property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the target supports C code, and the target has an interoperable calling
convention for C code, the Rust target must support that C calling convention
for the platform via <code>extern &quot;C&quot;</code>. The C calling convention does not need to
be the default Rust calling convention for the target, however.</li>
<li>The target must build reliably in CI, for all components that Rust's CI
considers mandatory.</li>
<li>The approving teams may additionally require that a subset of tests pass in
CI, such as enough to build a functional &quot;hello world&quot; program, <code>./x.py test --no-run</code>, or equivalent &quot;smoke tests&quot;. In particular, this requirement may
apply if the target builds host tools, or if the tests in question provide
substantial value via early detection of critical problems.</li>
<li>Building the target in CI must not take substantially longer than the current
slowest target in CI, and should not substantially raise the maintenance
burden of the CI infrastructure. This requirement is subjective, to be
evaluated by the infrastructure team, and will take the community importance
of the target into account.</li>
<li>Tier 2 targets should, if at all possible, support cross-compiling. Tier 2
targets should not require using the target as the host for builds, even if
the target supports host tools.</li>
<li>In addition to the legal requirements for all targets (specified in the tier
3 requirements), because a tier 2 target typically involves the Rust project
building and supplying various compiled binaries, incorporating the target
and redistributing any resulting compiled binaries (e.g. built libraries,
host tools if any) must not impose any onerous license requirements on any
members of the Rust project, including infrastructure team members and those
operating CI systems. This is a subjective requirement, to be evaluated by
the approving teams.
<ul>
<li>As an exception to this, if the target's primary purpose is to build
components for a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project licensed
under &quot;copyleft&quot; terms (terms which require licensing other code under
compatible FOSS terms), such as kernel modules or plugins, then the
standard libraries for the target may potentially be subject to copyleft
terms, as long as such terms are satisfied by Rust's existing practices of
providing full corresponding source code. Note that anything added to the
Rust repository itself must still use Rust's standard license terms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tier 2 targets must not impose burden on the authors of pull requests, or
other developers in the community, to ensure that tests pass for the target.
In particular, do not post comments (automated or manual) on a PR that derail
or suggest a block on the PR based on tests failing for the target. Do not
send automated messages or notifications (via any medium, including via <code>@</code>)
to a PR author or others involved with a PR regarding the PR breaking tests
on a tier 2 target, unless they have opted into such messages.
<ul>
<li>Backlinks such as those generated by the issue/PR tracker when linking to
an issue or PR are not considered a violation of this policy, within
reason. However, such messages (even on a separate repository) must not
generate notifications to anyone involved with a PR who has not requested
such notifications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The target maintainers should regularly run the testsuite for the target, and
should fix any test failures in a reasonably timely fashion.</li>
<li>All requirements for tier 3 apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>A tier 2 target may be demoted or removed if it no longer meets these
requirements. Any proposal for demotion or removal will be CCed to the target
maintainers, and will be communicated widely to the Rust community before being
dropped from a stable release. (The amount of time between such communication
and the next stable release may depend on the nature and severity of the failed
requirement, the timing of its discovery, whether the target has been part of a
stable release yet, and whether the demotion or removal can be a planned and
scheduled action.)</p>
<p>In some circumstances, especially if the target maintainers do not respond in a
timely fashion, Rust teams may land pull requests that temporarily disable some
targets in the nightly compiler, in order to implement a feature not yet
supported by those targets. (As an example, this happened when introducing the
128-bit types <code>u128</code> and <code>i128</code>.) Such a pull request will include notification
and coordination with the maintainers of such targets, and will ideally happen
towards the beginning of a new development cycle to give maintainers time to
update their targets. The maintainers of such targets will then be expected to
implement the corresponding target-specific support in order to re-enable the
target. If the maintainers of such targets cannot provide such support in time
for the next stable release, this may result in demoting or removing the
targets.</p>
<h3 id="tier-2-with-host-tools"><a class="header" href="#tier-2-with-host-tools">Tier 2 with host tools</a></h3>
<p>Some tier 2 targets may additionally have binaries built to run on them as a
host (such as <code>rustc</code> and <code>cargo</code>). This allows the target to be used as a
development platform, not just a compilation target.</p>
<p>A proposed new tier 2 target with host tools must be reviewed and approved by
the compiler team based on these requirements. Such review and approval may
occur via a <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/mcp.html">Major Change Proposal (MCP)</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, the infrastructure team must approve the integration of the
target's host tools into Continuous Integration (CI), and the CI-related
requirements for host tools. This review and approval may take place in a PR
adding the target's host tools to CI, or simply by an infrastructure team
member reporting the outcome of a team discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the target, its capabilities, its performance, and the
likelihood of use for any given tool, the host tools provided for a tier 2
target may include only <code>rustc</code> and <code>cargo</code>, or may include additional tools
such as <code>clippy</code> and <code>rustfmt</code>.</li>
<li>Approval of host tools will take into account the additional time required to
build the host tools, and the substantial additional storage required for the
host tools.</li>
<li>The host tools must have direct value to people other than the target's
maintainers. (It may still be a niche target, but the host tools must not be
exclusively useful for an inherently closed group.) This requirement will be
evaluated independently from the corresponding tier 2 requirement.
<ul>
<li>The requirement to provide &quot;direct value&quot; means that it does not suffice to
argue that having host tools will help the target's maintainers more easily
provide the target to others. The tools themselves must provide value to
others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There must be a reasonable expectation that the host tools will be used, for
purposes other than to prove that they can be used.</li>
<li>The host tools must build and run reliably in CI (for all components that
Rust's CI considers mandatory), though they may or may not pass tests.</li>
<li>Building host tools for the target must not take substantially longer than
building host tools for other targets, and should not substantially raise the
maintenance burden of the CI infrastructure.</li>
<li>The host tools must provide a substantively similar experience as on other
targets, subject to reasonable target limitations.
<ul>
<li>Adding a substantively different interface to an existing tool, or a
target-specific interface to the functionality of an existing tool,
requires design and implementation approval (e.g. RFC/MCP) from the
appropriate approving teams for that tool.
<ul>
<li>Such an interface should have a design that could potentially work for
other targets with similar properties.</li>
<li>This should happen separately from the review and approval of the target,
to simplify the target review and approval processes, and to simplify the
review and approval processes for the proposed new interface.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By way of example, a target that runs within a sandbox may need to modify
the handling of files, tool invocation, and similar to meet the
expectations and conventions of the sandbox, but must not introduce a
separate &quot;sandboxed compilation&quot; interface separate from the CLI interface
without going through the normal approval process for such an interface.
Such an interface should take into account potential other targets with
similar sandboxes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the host tools for the platform would normally be expected to be signed or
equivalent (e.g. if running unsigned binaries or similar involves a
&quot;developer mode&quot; or an additional prompt), it must be possible for the Rust
project's automated builds to apply the appropriate signature process,
without any manual intervention by either Rust developers, target
maintainers, or a third party. This process must meet the approval of the
infrastructure team.
<ul>
<li>This process may require one-time or semi-regular manual steps by the
infrastructure team, such as registration or renewal of a signing key. Any
such manual process must meet the approval of the infrastructure team.</li>
<li>This process may require the execution of a legal agreement with the
signature provider. Such a legal agreement may be revocable, and may
potentially require a nominal fee, but must not be otherwise onerous. Any
such legal agreement must meet the approval of the infrastructure team.
(The infrastructure team is not expected or required to sign binding legal
agreements on behalf of the Rust project; this review and approval exists
to ensure no terms are onerous or cause problems for infrastructure,
especially if such terms may impose requirements or obligations on people
who have access to target-specific infrastructure.)</li>
<li>Changes to this process, or to any legal agreements involved, may
cause a target to stop meeting this requirement.</li>
<li>This process involved must be available under substantially similar
non-onerous terms to the general public. Making it available exclusively to
the Rust project does not suffice.</li>
<li>This requirement exists to ensure that Rust builds, including nightly
builds, can meet the necessary requirements to allow users to smoothly run
the host tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Providing host tools does not exempt a target from requirements to support
cross-compilation if at all possible.</li>
<li>All requirements for tier 2 apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>A target may be promoted directly from tier 3 to tier 2 with host tools if it
meets all the necessary requirements, but doing so may introduce substantial
additional complexity. If in doubt, the target should qualify for tier 2
without host tools first.</p>
<h2 id="tier-1-target-policy"><a class="header" href="#tier-1-target-policy">Tier 1 target policy</a></h2>
<p>At this tier, the Rust project guarantees that a target builds and passes all
tests, and will reject patches that fail to build or pass the testsuite on a
target. We hold tier 1 targets to our highest standard of requirements.</p>
<p>A proposed new tier 1 target must be reviewed and approved by the compiler team
based on these requirements. In addition, the release team must approve the
viability and value of supporting the target. For a tier 1 target, this will
typically take place via a full RFC proposing the target, to be jointly
reviewed and approved by the compiler team and release team.</p>
<p>In addition, the infrastructure team must approve the integration of the target
into Continuous Integration (CI), and the tier 1 CI-related requirements. This
review and approval may take place in a PR adding the target to CI, by an
infrastructure team member reporting the outcome of a team discussion, or by
including the infrastructure team in the RFC proposing the target.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 targets must have substantial, widespread interest within the
developer community, and must serve the ongoing needs of multiple production
users of Rust across multiple organizations or projects. These requirements
are subjective, and determined by consensus of the approving teams. A tier 1
target may be demoted or removed if it becomes obsolete or no longer meets
this requirement.</li>
<li>The target maintainer team must include at least 3 developers.</li>
<li>The target must build and pass tests reliably in CI, for all components that
Rust's CI considers mandatory.
<ul>
<li>The target must not disable an excessive number of tests or pieces of tests
in the testsuite in order to do so. This is a subjective requirement.</li>
<li>If the target does not have host tools support, or if the target has low
performance, the infrastructure team may choose to have CI cross-compile
the testsuite from another platform, and then run the compiled tests
either natively or via accurate emulation. However, the approving teams may
take such performance considerations into account when determining the
viability of the target or of its host tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The target must provide as much of the Rust standard library as is feasible
and appropriate to provide. For instance, if the target can support dynamic
memory allocation, it must provide an implementation of <code>alloc</code> and the
associated data structures.</li>
<li>Building the target and running the testsuite for the target must not take
substantially longer than other targets, and should not substantially raise
the maintenance burden of the CI infrastructure.
<ul>
<li>In particular, if building the target takes a reasonable amount of time,
but the target cannot run the testsuite in a timely fashion due to low
performance of either native code or accurate emulation, that alone may
prevent the target from qualifying as tier 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If running the testsuite requires additional infrastructure (such as physical
systems running the target), the target maintainers must arrange to provide
such resources to the Rust project, to the satisfaction and approval of the
Rust infrastructure team.
<ul>
<li>Such resources may be provided via cloud systems, via emulation, or via
physical hardware.</li>
<li>If the target requires the use of emulation to meet any of the tier
requirements, the approving teams for those requirements must have high
confidence in the accuracy of the emulation, such that discrepancies
between emulation and native operation that affect test results will
constitute a high-priority bug in either the emulation or the
implementation of the target.</li>
<li>If it is not possible to run the target via emulation, these resources must
additionally be sufficient for the Rust infrastructure team to make them
available for access by Rust team members, for the purposes of development
and testing. (Note that the responsibility for doing target-specific
development to keep the target well maintained remains with the target
maintainers. This requirement ensures that it is possible for other
Rust developers to test the target, but does not obligate other Rust
developers to make target-specific fixes.)</li>
<li>Resources provided for CI and similar infrastructure must be available for
continuous exclusive use by the Rust project. Resources provided
for access by Rust team members for development and testing must be
available on an exclusive basis when in use, but need not be available on a
continuous basis when not in use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tier 1 targets must not have a hard requirement for signed, verified, or
otherwise &quot;approved&quot; binaries. Developers must be able to build, run, and
test binaries for the target on systems they control, or provide such
binaries for others to run. (Doing so may require enabling some appropriate
&quot;developer mode&quot; on such systems, but must not require the payment of any
additional fee or other consideration, or agreement to any onerous legal
agreements.)
<ul>
<li>The Rust project may decide to supply appropriately signed binaries if
doing so provides a smoother experience for developers using the target,
and a tier 2 target with host tools already requires providing appropriate
mechanisms that enable our infrastructure to provide such signed binaries.
However, this additional tier 1 requirement ensures that Rust developers
can develop and test Rust software for the target (including Rust itself),
and that development or testing for the target is not limited.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All requirements for tier 2 apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>A tier 1 target may be demoted if it no longer meets these requirements but
still meets the requirements for a lower tier. Any proposal for demotion of a
tier 1 target requires a full RFC process, with approval by the compiler and
release teams. Any such proposal will be communicated widely to the Rust
community, both when initially proposed and before being dropped from a stable
release. A tier 1 target is highly unlikely to be directly removed without
first being demoted to tier 2 or tier 3. (The amount of time between such
communication and the next stable release may depend on the nature and severity
of the failed requirement, the timing of its discovery, whether the target has
been part of a stable release yet, and whether the demotion or removal can be a
planned and scheduled action.)</p>
<p>Raising the baseline expectations of a tier 1 target (such as the minimum CPU
features or OS version required) requires the approval of the compiler and
release teams, and should be widely communicated as well, but does not
necessarily require a full RFC.</p>
<h3 id="tier-1-with-host-tools"><a class="header" href="#tier-1-with-host-tools">Tier 1 with host tools</a></h3>
<p>Some tier 1 targets may additionally have binaries built to run on them as a
host (such as <code>rustc</code> and <code>cargo</code>). This allows the target to be used as a
development platform, not just a compilation target.</p>
<p>A proposed new tier 1 target with host tools must be reviewed and approved by
the compiler team based on these requirements. In addition, the release team
must approve the viability and value of supporting host tools for the target.
For a tier 1 target, this will typically take place via a full RFC proposing
the target, to be jointly reviewed and approved by the compiler team and
release team.</p>
<p>In addition, the infrastructure team must approve the integration of the
target's host tools into Continuous Integration (CI), and the CI-related
requirements for host tools. This review and approval may take place in a PR
adding the target's host tools to CI, by an infrastructure team member
reporting the outcome of a team discussion, or by including the infrastructure
team in the RFC proposing the target.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 targets with host tools should typically include all of the additional
tools such as <code>clippy</code> and <code>rustfmt</code>, unless there is a target-specific
reason why a tool cannot possibly make sense for the target.
<ul>
<li>Unlike with tier 2, for tier 1 we will not exclude specific tools on the
sole basis of them being less likely to be used; rather, we'll take that
into account when considering whether the target should be at tier 1 with
host tools. In general, on any tier 1 target with host tools, people
should be able to expect to find and install all the same components that
they would for any other tier 1 target with host tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Approval of host tools will take into account the additional time required to
build the host tools, and the substantial additional storage required for the
host tools.</li>
<li>Host tools for the target must have substantial, widespread interest within
the developer community, and must serve the ongoing needs of multiple
production users of Rust across multiple organizations or projects. These
requirements are subjective, and determined by consensus of the approving
teams. This requirement will be evaluated independently from the
corresponding tier 1 requirement; it is possible for a target to have
sufficient interest for cross-compilation, but not have sufficient interest
for native compilation. The host tools may be dropped if they no longer meet
this requirement, even if the target otherwise qualifies as tier 1.</li>
<li>The host tools must build, run, and pass tests reliably in CI, for all
components that Rust's CI considers mandatory.
<ul>
<li>The target must not disable an excessive number of tests or pieces of tests
in the testsuite in order to do so. This is a subjective requirement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Building the host tools and running the testsuite for the host tools must not
take substantially longer than other targets, and should not substantially raise
the maintenance burden of the CI infrastructure.
<ul>
<li>In particular, if building the target's host tools takes a reasonable
amount of time, but the target cannot run the testsuite in a timely fashion
due to low performance of either native code or accurate emulation, that
alone may prevent the target from qualifying as tier 1 with host tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Providing host tools does not exempt a target from requirements to support
cross-compilation if at all possible.</li>
<li>All requirements for tier 2 targets with host tools apply.</li>
<li>All requirements for tier 1 apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>A target seeking promotion to tier 1 with host tools should typically either be
tier 2 with host tools or tier 1 without host tools, to reduce the number of
requirements to simultaneously review and approve.</p>
<p>In addition to the general process for demoting a tier 1 target, a tier 1
target with host tools may be demoted (including having its host tools dropped,
or being demoted to tier 2 with host tools) if it no longer meets these
requirements but still meets the requirements for a lower tier. Any proposal
for demotion of a tier 1 target (with or without host tools) requires a full
RFC process, with approval by the compiler and release teams. Any such proposal
will be communicated widely to the Rust community, both when initially proposed
and before being dropped from a stable release.</p>
